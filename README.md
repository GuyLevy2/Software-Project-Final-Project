# Software-Project-Final-Project

# TODO

- spkmeansmodule.c:
    - create a function for allocating c objects from python objects.
    - for each goal-function: use new alloc func and call the appropriate c function/s on it.
    - create free function?
    - create packaging function for returning the py objects?

- spkmeans.c:
    - main (full program, without ++ because it is a python init)

- spkmeans.py:
    - can we implement steps 5,6 in python?



- TESTING

TODO 2 (liad)
Free allocated memory in cases of detected errors during the run of the programm?
