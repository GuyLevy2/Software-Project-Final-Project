# Software-Project-Final-Project

# TODO

- spkmeansmodule.c:
    - create a function for allocating c objects from python objects.
    - for each goal-function: use new alloc func and call the appropriate c function/s on it.
    - create free function?
    - create packaging function for returning the py objects?

- spkmeans.c:
    - main (full program, without ++ because it is a python init)

- setup.py:
    - finish

- spkmeans.h:
    - fill in the functions' names

- spkmeans.py:
    - kmeansPP - do we need to keep the HW01 imp?



- TESTING
